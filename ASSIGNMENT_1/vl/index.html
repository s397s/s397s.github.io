    <h3 class="my-question">
      2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <p class="my-answer">
      Here's a list of actions I might take during a two-minute interaction with
      the website:
      <br />
      <br />1. Click to enable sound, as written on the screen <br />2. Move the
      mouse around as letters start to appear and form sentences <br />3. Scroll
      down to continue to the video <br />4. Scroll up to the previous page to

    <!----------- QUESTION 3 ---------->
    <h3 class="my-question">
      3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer"></p>

    <!----------- QUESTION 4 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer">
      As texts, images, videos and interactive elements are aligned in a
      vertical narrative format, the most common action is scrolling down pages,
      as it encourages users to actively interact with the content. This can be
      used strategically to control the flow of information, ensuring that users
      encounter key points or narratives in a structured manner while still
      giving them a sense of control over their experience. They can scroll at
      their own pace, pause to delve deeper into specific sections, or skip
      ahead to the next chapter.

    <!----------- QUESTION 5 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer">
      The core purpose of this website is to provide valuable knowledge and
      engaging experience about historical, cultural, and architectural aspects
      of the Wall Disney Concert Hall to its audience; which can be achieved by
      creating interactive features to encourages users to actively engage with
      the content rather than passively consuming it. This connects to active
      learning theories in academics, which suggest that people remember things
      better when they're actively engaged in learning process. This is a
      fundamental trait that most information-based websites should embody, and
      “Sculpting Harmony” has done such a great job. Moreover, this website
      gives off an impression that it might aim on a wide range of audiences
      based on the way the interface was designed.
    </p>

    <!----------- QUESTION 6 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer"></p>

    <!----------- QUESTION 7 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer">
      The experience leans towards short-term engagement. This suggests a focus
      on capturing the audience's attention and interest quickly, perhaps
      through performative visuals: bold color, appealing animation; concise
      information, interactive elements and sounds that make the initial visit
      engaging. Since the goal is short-term engagement, the design may
      prioritize delivering the core narrative or message effectively within a
      single visit, offering a complete experience that leaves a lasting impact
      without relying heavily on return visits for additional content or
      updates.
    </p>

    <!----------- QUESTION 8 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer">
      Unlike other E-Commerce or Language learning platforms that offer regular
      updates or personalized contents to encourage sustained interaction over
      time, this type website concentrates on its initial impact without
      providing ongoing incentives for revisits. However, this experience can be
      linked to reading a book or watching a movie as these forms of media
      remain unchanged over time, yet people often revisit them for the
      experience or enjoyment. A website's content also remains consistent but
      encourages revisits for the richness of the story or the immersive
      experience it offers. Therefore, it is crucial to design the interface in
      a way that prioritizes enhancing user experience, aiming to create a
      lasting impact from the first use and increase the value of revisits.
    </p>

    <!----------- QUESTION 9 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer">
      The experience of exploring the story of a music hall on an interactive
      website can also reference movies or film media forms. For instance, there
      are match-cut transitions in the interview section that seamlessly connect
      two pictures of the hall. Additionally, short footage shows the camera
      moving around to provide a wide-angle view of the music hall, offering a
      complete picture of its grandeur.l, giving us a complete picture of it.
      <br />
      <br />The integration of music also adds another layer of depth, with
      several classical pieces playing in the background changing to match with
      different mood of each section. Notably, when there's a conversation, the
      music stops briefly to ensure people focus better on the dialogues,
      mirroring the cinematic practice of using sound to enhance storytelling
      nuances. This adds a touch of cinematic flair, making the journey through
      music hall history more vivid and evocative.
    </p>
    <!----------- QUESTION 10 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer">
      The majority of the website is written blog format, users only need to
      continuously scroll down to read the content. The part that shows the
      interview, however, has similar feature with Instagram and Facebook
      Stories. In which, Stories (short videos) will play automatically as you
      tap on a profile picture in the Story feed. Each Story segment, whether
      it's a photo or video, progresses seamlessly to the next one, creating a
      continuous viewing experience. While viewing a Story, you can interact
      with it using tap gestures, You can tap left or right to jump back and
      forth between different stories in your feed.
      <br />
      <br />Young people uses Instagram and Facebook everyday, so this feature
      is incredibly familiar to them, it has become a staple of their social
      media experience. I know exactly where to click as soon as I saw in dash
      line at the bottom of the video. This feature is great because it bridges
      generational gaps by presenting such topics in a fresh way. Not
      necessarily to make it easier for young people to use, but to show an
      effort to make these kind of subjects relevant and engaging for them.
    </p>
    <!----------- QUESTION 11 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
      feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer">
      The website is a combination of a traditional theme (concert hall) and a
      modern interface with vibrant colors like orange and light green, along
      with youthful, bold sleek line illustrations. All of which may bring a
      sense of contrast and dynamism at first. However, each element enhances
      the other in a harmonious way. The classic old music aesthetic evokes a
      sense of nostalgia and heritage, while the striking new aesthetic brings
      boldness and modernity. This blend creates an emotional depth that adds
      layers to the overall experience, making it more memorable and fresh.
    </p>

    <!----------- QUESTION 12 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p class="my-answer">
      <img
        src="1.jpg"
        alt=""
        width="50%"
        margin-right="10px"
        style="float: right"
      />
      <br />
      From an individual standpoint, despite these memerizing visual elements,
      the hugh overflowing headline font seems a but off. It was impressing at
      first but becomes visually overwhelming when repeated, especially in large
      sizes that almost take up an entire page. This cartoonish font may could
      be a intentionally choice of aesthetic, however, it can be visually
      disturbing when presented on large screens and become a challenge for
      older audiences who are not accustomed to such styles. This is worth
      considering, given that the website targets a wide range of age groups.
    </p>

    <!----------- QUESTION 13 ---------->

    <h3 class="my-question">
      13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
